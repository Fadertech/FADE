Fade development tree

Fade is a PoS-based cryptocurrency.

Fade is dependent upon libsecp256k1.

Fade includes an Address Index feature, based on the address index API (searchrawtransactions RPC command) implemented in Bitcoin Core but modified implementation to work with the Fade codebase (PoS coins maintain a txindex by default for instance).

Initialize the Address Index By Running with -reindexaddr Command Line Argument.  It may take 10-15 minutes to build the initial index.
